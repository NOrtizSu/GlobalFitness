/**
 * Built-in exercises and machines. Ids are stored in workouts and in the cloud backup: never
 * rename or remove one (mark it hidden in a later version if needed). Names are string resources
 * `ex_<id>` (tools/i18n/src/<locale>/97_exercises.txt).
 *
 * Muscles follow the usual hard-set counting: [CatalogExercise.primary] are the prime movers (one
 * set each), [CatalogExercise.secondary] the synergists that get real work (half a set); stabilizers
 * are left out so the weekly volume is not inflated. Every muscle of the body map is the primary of
 * at least two entries, so each one can be trained from the catalog alone.
 *
 * Stretches and mobility drills ([CatalogExercise.mobility]) are logged by time and exported as
 * stretching segments, but they are not training load: their primary muscles are the ones they
 * stretch, and they add no hard sets, recovery, strength trend or records. The rule above (two
 * primaries per muscle) holds without them.
 *
 * Health Connect: [CatalogExercise.hcSegment] is set only when a segment type really names the
 * movement (null exports as generic weightlifting). Every strength segment used here is accepted by
 * the STRENGTH_TRAINING, WEIGHTLIFTING and CALISTHENICS session types; a cardio segment is accepted
 * only by its own session type ([CatalogExercise.hcSession]).

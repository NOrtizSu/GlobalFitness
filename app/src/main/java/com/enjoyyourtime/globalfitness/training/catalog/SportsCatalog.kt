/**
 * Sports and outdoor activities ("Sports and activities" in the catalog), part of
 * [ExerciseCatalog.all]. Ids are stored like every catalog id: never rename or remove one. Names
 * are `ex_<id>` and guides `exg_<id>_steps` / `exg_<id>_tips` (tools/i18n/src/<locale>/97_sports.txt
 * and 97_sport_guides.txt).
 *
 * A sport is usually the whole session ("football, 90 min"): it is logged as [CARDIO] (time,
 * calories, and the distance where the activity covers one, see [coversDistance]), with no machine
 * level. Like the cardio machines it never counts as training volume (weekly hard sets, recovery,
 * strength trends, records: see TrainingMath.countsForMuscles); its muscles, the ones the activity
 * mostly loads, are only shown in the info sheet and the animation.
 *
 * Health Connect: [CatalogExercise.hcSession] is the session type a workout with only this activity
 * is saved as. Football and futsal are "Soccer", padel (which Health Connect does not have) is
 * "Tennis", its closest racket sport, and swimming is "Swimming (pool)", where most people log their
 * lengths; such a session takes the activity's own name as its title (see WorkoutExerciseInfo.title).
 * [CatalogExercise.hcSegment] is set only where a segment type names the activity and its session
 * type accepts it (walking, running, cycling, pool swimming, yoga, pilates); the others are written
 * as "other workout" segments, like the sets of a mixed workout.

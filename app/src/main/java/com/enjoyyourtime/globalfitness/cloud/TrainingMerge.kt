/**
 * Pure merge of the training data (workouts, custom exercises, exercise notes and their photos, the
 * user's routines) with the cloud copy. No Android, no Firebase; unit-tested.
 *
 * Unlike measurements, every training document carries a client `updatedAt` that the repository
 * bumps past the version it edited (`max(now, previous + 1)`, deletions too), and every local
 * deletion leaves a tombstone. So the rule per document is plain last-writer-wins:
 * - both sides live and different: the higher `updatedAt` wins (ties: the cloud copy). This also
 *   heals a cloud copy overwritten by an older, late write.
 * - live vs tombstone: the tombstone wins over a live copy with `updatedAt <= deletedAt`, and always
 *   over the very version this phone had agreed on (whatever the clocks say). A deletion of a known
 *   version is uploaded with `deletedAt` past that version, so no phone resurrects it.
 * - the [TrainingBase] tells which local documents changed since the last sync (uploads are decided
 *   without reading the whole collection), which version was agreed, and which documents were
 *   deleted: a live cloud copy not newer than a known deletion (an old write that landed late) gets
 *   the tombstone again instead of coming back.
 * - a local tombstone is always uploaded unless the cloud already shows one: an unconfirmed put of
 *   that document may still be waiting in Firestore's offline queue.
 * - a custom exercise used by a workout or a routine is never removed from the phone: it is kept
 *   archived (the history and the routines keep its name), newer than the tombstone, as the
 *   repository does for a local removal. An exercise the phone does not know yet (a workout or
 *   routine restored before its machine) is shown as unknown until it arrives.
 *
 * Photos are content addressed (SHA-256): uploaded only when the cloud does not have that hash yet
 * (and not again while an earlier upload waits in the offline queue), deleted when no note uses them
 * any more. A note whose photo file is missing on the phone ([NoteRecord.photoMissing]) never changes
 * the cloud's photo: it takes the cloud's and downloads it.
